# Food Piles

Food Piles is a mobile app that facilitates new community connections to solve local food demands.

## Mission

The hospitality industry has a food waste problem. Restaurants discard an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds of food each year. Even though these numbers are staggering, a restaurant can never reasonably utilize 100% of its daily food supply in the dining room. Thatâ€™s why we launched Food Piles, in response to this disconnect. We help pair restaurants with food kitchens and food banks so they have a place to consistently drop off their excess food at the end of the day, which prevents it from going into the garbage. Restaurants can discover nearby charities that they can reach out to and connect with, and vice versa, allowing for a convenient and mutually beneficial relationship between the two organizations.
